# PhishThem
Little project I'm working on a multifunction Advanced Phishing Tool written in Python3


Another phishing tool? I know I've seen alot of good projects on github for phishing but this is my version
Most phishing scripts are all based off each other, most of the time they're clones 
With different names so I've decided to make a new one 
From scratch with cleaner and more advanced functionality



/*Notice this isn't my complete tool it's really not finished therefore I will upload 
The script when I'm done and have the working version, then keep updating it once it's released*/
